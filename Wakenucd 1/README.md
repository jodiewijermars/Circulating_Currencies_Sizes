# Wakenucd 1

As end result of my three iterations I made a new banknote: the Wakennucd 1.
It is a fictive banknote, but illustrates the combination of 15 currencies, to make a new average banknote.
The currencies I used are:
- Angolan kwanza
- Ethiopian birr
- Eritrean nakar
- Egyptian pound
- United States dollar
- Dominican peso
- East carribean dollar
- Djibouti franc
- Danish krone
- Czech koruna
- Euro
- Netherlands antilles guilder
- Cuban convertible peso 
- Croatian kuna
- West african franc
