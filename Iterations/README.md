# Three iterations

I made three iterations of the list of 223 ciculating currencies:
- Banknote dimensions [millimetres]
- Banknote dimensions mixed [millimetres]
- Dominant colors of 15 currencies
- List of circulating currencies, colors in list are a reference to the 15 currencies I used for the dominant colors

## Posters of the iterations
